A collection of code in esoteric languages

Interested in other esolangs?  Check out https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page

## INTERCAL

The original esoteric language.

The instruction manual - well worth reading - is located here: http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/intercal-man/

On OS X, you can `brew install intercal`, and then run Befunge code with the appropriately-named command `ick`.

You can compile/run these with the online interpreter at: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_intercal_online.php

## Befunge

A two-dimensional programming language.

On OS X, you can `brew install befunge93`, and then run Befunge code with the command `bef`.

A befunge tutorial is here: http://bef-93.blogspot.com/2014/06/bef-93-tutorial.html

## ArnoldC

The only programming language to use keywords based on lines from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.
